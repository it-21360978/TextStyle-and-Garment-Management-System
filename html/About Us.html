                From a dream to reality Vivacious designs and textile was created as a collection of ideas 
                between five friends. We as a company are bound to satisfy consumer's clothing desires through 
                innovative thinking and adapting new technology in order to provide the best quality product.
                All of our products are available in a wide variety of colors and material which suits any gender 
                and any age. The key feature that differentiates our services from a regular online clothing 
                store is that we are providing the ability to the consumer to buy the clothing materials which 
                are used to make our final finished product. We also consider consumer feedback on products and 
                make the necessary adjustments for our products and materials in order to provide a better 
                service for the consumer.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class = OurGoal>
            <h2 id = "OurGoalT" align = "right">Our Goal</h2>
            <img src = "../images/Our goal.jpg" width = "350px" height = "460px" style = "margin: 47px 45px" align = "right">
            <p id = para2>
                Our main goals we hope to achieve using the company involves improving the product awareness 
                for the consumers. To achieve this goal, we have created a online platform for purchasing of 
                our products and materials. We have provided the ability for amateur designers to make a name 
                for themselves by providing us designs ideas and making the designers reputable in the clothing 
                sector locally and internationally. Another main goal ever since the beginning of the company 
                has been the utilization of the cultural aspects for our designs making our company unique in 
                the international market and in the meanwhile helping the preservation of the culture. As a 
                customer friendly company, we hope to strengthen the customer services while making the company 
                profitable by maintaining and increasing profits.

            <h2 id = "SimplicityT">Simplicity In Design</h2>

                When ever a consumer tries to purchase an item, they will mainly see products that can be categorized 
                into two main categories such as a product with a complex nature and also a product with a simple 
                nature. The main objective of our company is to make the selection available for the customer simple, 
                saving the consumer precious time while providing the best customer satisfaction. That's why we have 
                made our designs simple while using the most advanced techniques and materials to produce the clothes. 
                We have made our designs the simplest it can be without making the consumer hate the designs and become 
                bored with our products after a while. This is what's known as simplicity in design.
